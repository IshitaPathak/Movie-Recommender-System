# Movie Recommender System

This project is a content-based movie recommender system built using cosine similarity to find the list of five closest similar movies. The system leverages vectorization of words and Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for efficient processing and recommendation generation.

- Content-based movie recommendation algorithm
- Utilizes cosine similarity for movie similarity computation
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of movie database
- Seamless interaction through a Streamlit frontend
- Utilizes TMDB database containing information for 5000 movies
